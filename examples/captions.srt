1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,004
By default unreal engine has auto exposure enabled

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,074
 that means that depending on how much is seem on the map

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,074
the brightness is going to change

4
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:13,710
you will probably want to change that

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,882
to disable it simply drag and drop and PostProcessVolume

6
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:26,055
Go to "Exposure" and set  "Min-Max Brightness" to 1

7
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:30,525
and make the post process volume unbound

8
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:34,280
this will disable auto exposure for the entire map

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,285
now the brightness will not change
